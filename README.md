HR Analytics Data Visualization

## __Background__

Good data visualization can help us understand what kind of information is contained in a dataset, can extract information from it, help in identifying patterns. Data visualization can also help if there is a lack of understanding of a field of study or a lack of domain knowledge, or simply wants to check the data for further steps such as data pre-processing. On this occasion, I will try to do data visualization of the hr case. 

## __Context and Content__

A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully pass some courses which conduct by the company. Many people signup for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates are really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment.

## __Objective__

Find any patterns related to the dataset, preferably for business purposes.

## __Findings and Discussions__

In general, candidates come from pretty decent cities. This is indicated by the index of cities that are classified as decent, where most of them are above 0.7 .

For those who come from a city that is pretty decent, most of them are men.

This is interesting, because it turns out that most of the participants that have relevant experience with what the company needs, many of whom already have more than 20 years of working experience. This begs for questionable reason behind their participation in the training session.

Where, most of them, when applying for jobs and training in this company, is not taking other courses from some university. Therefore, they can be focused on the training the company provided.
